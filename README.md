# Overview

For this project, I decided to create a useful list that I may reference in the future, as it is a goal of mine to hike more of the 14ers in the USA. Along the way,
this project has taught me how to format data to use in GIS, and what variables and parameters to use to properly display it. The software I wrote has pop-ups,
filters for various mountain heights, and different displayed layers. The data is publicly available on a variety of sites, so I mainly used wikipedia, as it was
simpler than importing data from other sources, and was accurate.

# Development Environment

To develop this website, I used ArcGIS online, google sheets, and wikipedia. Most of the data was found on wikipedia, 
with information verified and filled for a few bits from other websites. The data was modified in google sheets to transfer well to ArcGIS. 
Then it was created by using a feature layer with an arcade expression popup, and modified and edited into a website using the ArcGIS apps feature.

# Useful Websites

* [ArcGIS](https://byui.maps.arcgis.com)
* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteener)

# Future Work

* Add mountain ranges
* Add 14ers in other countries
* Change state coloration to display something else, perhaps average elevation
